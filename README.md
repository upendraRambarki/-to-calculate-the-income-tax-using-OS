question 1:
Using thread, write a program to calculate the income tax. Take salary as input from the user. The thread must pass the final value of calculated income tax to the main thread.
Conditions to calculate tax, if salary is:
Less than or equal to 4,00,000 – 1%
Greater than 4,00,000 and Less than 10,00,000 – 5%
Greater than 10,00,000 – 12%

Question 2:
Consider a shared resource whose value is 2. Consider two threads. First thread increments the value of shared resource by 2,
 second thread divides the value shared resource by 2. Write a program to demonstrate race hazard using the given situation.

Question 3:
Create a parent process and a child process and using concept of pipe write a program to pass the first 8 characters of 
“Hey there! WhatsApp is using me” from the child process to the parent process

Question 4:
Write first program to print the table of a number. Write second program to print the Fibonacci series. Now, implement a strategy to run the second program into first program without writing the actual code of second program in first program.
